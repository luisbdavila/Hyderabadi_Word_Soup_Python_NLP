    "+ As expected, due to the region our data originates from, we can see that asian cuisines are much more common than western ones. With the most commonly reviewed cuisine type being North Indian, the second most common being Chinese, Continental in third and Biryani in fourth. \n",
    "+ Interestingly, Italian cuisine is quite high on the list, this may be due to it being more internationally recognizable than other western cuisines. \n",
    "+ We can also see that latin cuisines (excluding Italian) are very seldom reviewed. The least reviewed cuisine is Pizza, which makes some sense since it can actually be seen as a subdivision of Italian cuisine and, thus, it may simply be more specific than other cuisines present on the list. \n",
    "+ The healthy food cuisine also contains very few reviews, this could be due to the people in this particular region being less conscious/worried about healthy eating habits, compared to western cultures.\n",
    "+ The distribution is, as expected, unbalanced, as such we'll use techniques like stratification, class weights and evaluating with F1-score to attempt to mitigate this unbalance."

    "Looking at the test set classification report, we can see that our model achieves an average F1-score of 0.43 and a weighted average F1-score of 0.56. Let’s now dive a little deeper and highlight some of the biggest takeaways:\n",
    "+ The model, as expected, captures the more common classes quite well, with the majority class (NorthIndian) having an F1-score of 0.8, which is comfortably the highest and the second and third (Chinese and Continental, respectively) most common cuisines having F1-scores above 0.6.\n",
    "+ It is also worth noting that some of the least common classes (such as Wraps and NorthEastern, for example) also achieve decent F1-scores above 0.55.\n",
    "+ As expected from the wordcloud analysis, despite not being very common the Ice Cream class achieves a satisfactory F1-score of 0.57.\n",
    "+ On the other hand, the Pizza class, which despite being rare had a very distinct vocabulary, was not picked up well by our model, achieving an extremely poor F1-score of 0.16.\n",
    "+ The Bakery and Café cuisines described as having similar vocabularies which were quite unique compared to the rest of the cuisines, also achieved decent F1-scores, around 0.55.\n",
    "Overall, as expected, our model was able to pick up some patterns describing cuisines in the reviews, but the results are not very good, this could be since reviews in some cases may be too short or don’t contain enough information to allow for the inference of cuisine type.\n"
